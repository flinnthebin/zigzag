File-Based Router that routes based files.

## MVP

- Segregated RPi
- ssh RPi
- curl pdf
- pdftotext pdf (sanitize)
- upload text to RPi segregated github
- exit ssh
- clone on main machine

## Reaching Goals

- Integrate into Firefox to intercept file download, interpet type as pdf, automate MVP

## Why would you make this?

Because security is a nebulous concept and this is technically more secure than downloading 'free textbooks'
